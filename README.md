# Beginner python projects
There are my first projects in python. I learned a lot after doing these projects, and I want to expand the complexity of my projects gradually.
I have created number guessing game, in which users are trying to guess what number computer is thinking.
Then I created rock, paper, and scissors game, which is more functional, and users play the classic game against computer.
Finally, I write a code for my own to do list app. This project has its save and load system too.
